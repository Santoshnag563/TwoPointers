Sliding Window Technique in Java

    The sliding window technique is a common algorithmic approach used to efficiently solve problems
    involving subarrays or substrings. It involves maintaining a window of a fixed or variable size
    that slides over the input sequence. This technique is particularly useful for problems that require
    finding the maximum or minimum value within a specific window size or counting occurrences of a particular
    pattern within a given window.

How it Works:

    Initialize the Window:
        Define two pointers, left and right, to mark the boundaries of the window.
        Initially, both pointers are set to the beginning of the input sequence.
    Expand the Window:
        Move the right pointer to the right, expanding the window.
        Calculate the desired result for the current window.
    Shrink the Window:
        If the window size exceeds the required limit, move the left pointer to the right, shrinking the window.
    Repeat:
        Continue steps 2 and 3 until the right pointer reaches the end of the input sequence.
        Example: Maximum Sum Subarray of Size K



Key Points:

    Efficiency: The sliding window technique often reduces time complexity by avoiding unnecessary calculations.
    Flexibility: It can be adapted to solve various problems, including finding the longest substring without
                 repeating characters, counting the number of occurrences of a substring, and more.
    Sliding Window Variations: There are different variations of the sliding window technique, such
                   as the fixed-size sliding window and the variable-size sliding window.

    By understanding the sliding window technique, you can efficiently solve a wide range of algorithmic
    problems in Java.
