Two-Pointer vs. Sliding Window: A Comparative Analysis

    While both techniques involve using two pointers to traverse a data structure, they have distinct
    characteristics and applications.

Two-Pointer Technique:

Core Idea:

    Uses two pointers to iterate over a data structure, often in opposite directions, to solve
    problems involving comparisons, merging, or finding specific patterns.

Key Characteristics:

    Pointers can move independently or in tandem.
    Often used with sorted arrays or linked lists.
    Focuses on the relationship between elements at the pointer positions.

Common Use Cases:

    Two Sum problem: Find two numbers that add up to a target sum.
    Valid Palindrome: Determine if a string is a palindrome.
    Merge Sorted Arrays: Merge two sorted arrays into a single sorted array.

Sliding Window Technique:

Core Idea:

    Uses two pointers to maintain a window of a fixed or variable size over a data structure,
    typically an array or string.

Key Characteristics:

    One pointer (right) expands the window, while the other (left) shrinks it.
    Often used with arrays or strings to find subarrays or substrings with specific properties.
    Focuses on the elements within the window and their collective properties.

Common Use Cases:

    1. Maximum Sum Subarray of Size K: Find the contiguous subarray of size K with the maximum sum.
    2. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters: Find the length of the longest substring without repeating
    characters.
    3. Minimum Window Substring: Find the minimum window substring that contains all characters of a given pattern.
