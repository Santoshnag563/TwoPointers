Carry Forward Approach in Java

    The carry forward approach is a technique often used in algorithmic problem-solving to optimize solutions.
    It involves carrying over information from one iteration of a loop to the next, reducing redundant
    calculations and improving efficiency.

Common Use Cases:

    1. Dynamic Programming (ex: fibonacci series)
    2. Number Theory (ex: factorial)
    3. Array and String Manipulation (ex: reversing a string)


Key Benefits:

    1. Reduced Time Complexity: By avoiding redundant calculations, the overall time complexity of the algorithm
    can be improved.
    2. Optimized Space Usage: In some cases, the carry forward approach can reduce the need for additional
    data structures, leading to lower space complexity.
    3. Simplified Code: The code often becomes more concise and easier to understand.

Important Considerations:

    1. Initialization: Ensure that the initial values for the carry-forward variables are correct.
    2. Update Logic: The update logic should be carefully designed to correctly incorporate the carry-forward
     values.
    3. Edge Cases: Consider edge cases and boundary conditions to ensure the correctness of the algorithm.
